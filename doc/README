This directory contains files for preparing Demos Commander
User's Guide, Reference Manual and Release Notes.

Formatting of documentation is done using TeX and LaTeX.
Figures are prepared in PostScript format and inserted
into document while formatting.

Resulting files have PostScript format.

To rebuild documentation you need:

    1) TeX with cmr fonts
    2) LaTeX
    3) psfig macro package
    4) dvips converter
    5) nroff with -man macro package

All of these are in Public Domain, and you can get it by anonymous ftp
from various places.


This directory contains following files:

    Makefile            -- makefile for preparing documents
    README              -- this file

    adv.ps.Z            -- formatted brief advertisment (compressed)
    guide.ps.Z          -- formatted User's Guide (compressed)
    notes.ps.Z          -- formatted Release Notes (compressed)
    ref.ps.Z            -- formatted Reference Manual (compressed)
    title.ps.Z          -- formatted title of UG (compressed)

    ref.lp              -- formatted Refence Manual (text file)

    adv.tex             -- brief advertisment (LaTeX)
    guide.tex           -- User's Guide (LaTeX)
    header.tex          -- header file, included into guide.tex
    title.tex           -- title of UG (TeX)

    notes.txt           -- Release Notes (plain text file)
    ref.man             -- Reference Manual (nroff -man)

    guide.sty           -- style file for User's Guide (LaTeX)

    txt2latex.c         -- converter from plain text to LaTeX
    txt2ps.c            -- converter from plain text to PostScript

    pic/                -- directory, containing figures
    pic/Makefile        -- makefile for builing figures
    pic/HEADER          -- header file for printing figures (PostScript)
    pic/p*.scr          -- figures in 'screen' format
    pic/ps2ps.c         -- PostScript to PostScript filter
    pic/scr2lj.c        -- converter from screen format to LaserJet
    pic/scr2ps.c        -- converter from screen format to PostScript


To build all these, execute command:

    % make dvi

All TeX documents will be formatted, and you will get DVI files.
To get right cross references in guide.dvi, you should reformat it
once more. To do it, run :

    % make refresh

Then, make PostScript files by command:

    % make ps

Following schemes show how all documents are formatted:

User's Guide:
    (LaTeX)     guide.tex + guide.sty + header.tex + pic/p*.ps -> guide.dvi
    (dvips)     guide.dvi + pic/header.ps + pic/p*.ps -> guide.ps

Reference Manual:
    (nroff)     ref.man -> ref.lp
    (txt2latex) ref.lp -> ref.tex
    (LaTeX)     ref.tex -> ref.dvi
    (txt2ps)    ref.lp -> ref.ps

Release Notes:
    (Makefile)  notes.txt -> notes.tex
    (LaTeX)     notes.tex -> notes.dvi
    (txt2ps)    notes.txt -> notes.ps

Title:
    (TeX)       title.tex -> title.dvi
    (dvips)     title.dvi -> title.ps

Advertisement:
    (LaTeX)     adv.tex -> adv.dvi
    (dvips)     adv.dvi -> adv.ps
