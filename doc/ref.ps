(DESCRIPTION) 14 P
(     DECO, or Demos Commander, is a visual interface for the UNIX) 15 P

(Functional Keys) 22 P
(     DECO is adjusted to the type of terminal by means of the) 23 P
(     termcap terminal description file. While in operation, DECO) 24 P
(     uses 10 functional keys F1-F10. To determine the keys,) 25 P

(Command Canceling and Exit from Deco) 22 P
(     In any state of DECO, press F10 to reset and cancel the) 23 P
(     current menu. If DECO is in the usual mode \(system command) 24 P
(     input\), F10 calls for an exit from the DECO menu:) 25 P
(           Do you want to exit from DECO commander?) 27 P
(           Yes No Shell) 28 P
(     Yes \(exit\), No \(no exit\), and Shell \(run csh\) should be) 30 P

(     PC\). If Shell is selected, you have to input the exit com-) 32 P
(     mand in order to return to DECO.) 33 P
(Getting Help) 35 P
(     F1 provides you with a built-in help message. Press F10 to) 36 P
(     return to DECO.) 37 P
(Deco Windows and Operation Modes) 39 P
(     Usually, DECO shows two panels \(right and left ones\), two) 40 P
(     directories are displayed there. One of these panels is the) 41 P
(     current one, where all the operations take place \(the name) 42 P
(     of this panel is printed in italics\). The second panel is) 43 P
(     used to point out the place to copy, move or link files, as) 44 P
(     well as to present information about the current directory) 45 P
(     \(see the ^L command\). The TAB command \(Tab or ^I key\) serves) 46 P
(     as a fast way to select another panel as the current one,) 47 P
(     the key ^U is used to swap panels on the screen.) 48 P
(     System commands are executed from DECO in the same manner,) 50 P
(     as from the usual interpreter sh or csh \(see below, Running) 51 P
(     UNIX Commands\). DECO calls for the csh interpreter to exe-) 52 P
(     cute commands. The single restriction is that SHELL is res-) 53 P
(     tarted each time, so variable values, aliases, jobs, etc.) 54 P
(     are not memorized.  Initially, DECO is set to the screen) 55 P
(     mode, where panels, status line \(in the upper part of the) 56 P
(     screen, which includes the names of machine, user, terminal) 57 P
(     and current time\), and hint line \(in the lower part of the) 58 P
(     screen\) are displayed. In this mode, all DECO commands are) 59 P
(Printed 5/4/91                                                  2) 63 P

(     executed \(F1 - F10 and others\). After a DECO command is) 8 P
(     over, DECO remains in the command input mode. No panels and) 9 P
(     prompts are displayed in this mode \(for faster operation\).) 10 P
(     In this mode, only system commands are executed, as well as) 11 P
(     some DECO commands, such as ^B \(operation with History com-) 12 P
(     mands journal\). Once an empty command \(Return\) is entered,) 13 P
(     DECO returns to the screen mode, and panels are displayed.) 14 P
(     In some cases, DECO can move to the screen mode without) 15 P
(     highlighting the panels \(for example, calling for History) 16 P
(     from the non-screen mode\). During operations with different) 17 P
(     menus, DECO moves to the menu mode. In this case, the com-) 18 P
(     mands listed in the menu are executed, arrows move the cur-) 19 P
(     sor along the menu, F10 means always "Cancel the MENU mode".) 20 P
(Executing Unix Commands) 22 P
(     DECO is usually set to the screen mode when you can use) 23 P
(     arrows to travel across the directory and select files, as) 24 P
(     well as form a command line by entering characters. You can) 25 P
(     add the names of the current and selected files to the end) 26 P
(     of the command line by the LineFeed or ^J commands. Using ^E) 27 P
(     and ^X commands, it is possible to move along the History,) 28 P
(     i.e. to "recall" previously executed commands. To erase the) 29 P
(     command line, use the ^Y command.) 30 P
(     System commands executed are memorized in the History. You) 32 P
(     can call for History from the DECO main menu, as well as by) 33 P
(     the ^B command. In History, arrows move the cursor along the) 34 P
(     commands, the ^J command serves to insert the current file) 35 P
(     name into the command line, Return - to insert the current) 36 P
(     file name and execute the command.) 37 P
(     The EDIT mode serves to correct the command line. This mode) 39 P
(     is characterized by the fact that a directory name is not) 40 P
(     italicized in DECO panels. The ^P command turns this mode on) 41 P
(     and off. In EDIT, arrows move the cursor along the command) 42 P
(     line and across History. Commands Del or ^G delete charac-) 43 P
(     ters under the cursor.) 44 P
(     Command ^V serves for quoting non-printable characters.) 46 P
(     Next symbol, following this command, will be inserted into) 47 P
(     command line.) 48 P
(File Types) 50 P
(     DECO differs regular, special files and directories.  Type) 51 P
(     of file is marked to the left of file name by character tag.) 52 P
(     There are following file tags:) 53 P
(     space) 55 P
(          regular file) 56 P
(     *    executable file) 58 P

(Handling Selected Files) 24 P
(     Selected files are used to set filenames for commands. Only) 25 P
(     regular files can be selected. To select the files \(and to) 26 P
(     cancel the selection\), the following commands can be used:) 27 P
(     Ins or ^T) 29 P
