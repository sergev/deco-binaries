DECO is a visual screen shell for the UNIX operating system.
It is analogous with famous "Norton Commander".

DECO can be used with any UNIX terminal, attached to UNIX operating
system.  The terminal must have direct cursor addressing mode and
80-character screen width.

DECO uses all possibilities of your terminal - keypad and functional
keys, colors, line drawing character set.

User's Guide is available in PostScript format.

DECO is not freeware.  It is available free of charge for free unixes
only, i.e. for FreeBSD, NetBSD, 386bsd and Linux.

If you need DECO for commercial Unix platforms, please send e-mail to
<deco-request@zebub.msk.su>.  It will cost you money, however.
